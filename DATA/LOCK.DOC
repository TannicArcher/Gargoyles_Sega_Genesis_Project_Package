                        TERRITORY LOCKOUT CODE

LOCK.INC contains code which will prevent cartridges from being run on
machines not listed in the Country Codes field of the ID Block.  It
should ALWAYS be included in your source code immediately after the 
ICD_BLK4. In all Genesis games, the initial PC must point to the ICD 
Block4.  The code executed once the ICD_BLk4 program is done, must be 
the lockout code.

The lockout code checks the hardware's ID against the 
country codes in the ID block and, if there's no match, prints a 
message identifying the legal territories for the cartridge.  Then it 
simply hangs.

This code has been burnt and tested on all rev's of the Genesis.  It
performs properly.

Lock.A has been included as a reference for what the code is actually
doing.

Below is an example of where to include the lockout code.

;This code does not have to be here, but it must exist somewhere in the
;ROM byte for byte (at an even address) and must be the first code
;executed. (i.e. the PC start vector at address 4 should point to it).
;It tests and sets up most of the hardware. It does not however set up
;a stack pointer as it does not require one internally! It is essential
;that the vector at address 0 contains a valid stack start address or
;a valid address is loaded into register 'a7' prior to execution of further
;code following ICD_BLK4.
